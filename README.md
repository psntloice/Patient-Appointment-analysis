# Patient-Appointment-analysis
Data analysis project
### Dataset Description 

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
<li>‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.</li>
<li>‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.</li>
<li>‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.</li>
<li>'AppointmentId' is the date of appointment</li>
<li>'Appointmentday' actual appointment day</li>
<li>'Gender'</li>
<li>'Age' age of the patient</li>
<li>'Diabetes'</li>
<li>'PatientID' identification of the patient</li>
<li>'Hipertension'</li>
<li>'Alcoholism</li>
<li>'SMS_received'</li>
<li>'Handcapped'</li>
<li>'No-show' whether the patient showed up or not</li>
<li>Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.</li>
